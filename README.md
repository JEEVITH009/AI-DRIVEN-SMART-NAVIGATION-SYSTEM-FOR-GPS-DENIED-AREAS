# AI-DRIVEN-SMART-NAVIGATION-SYSTEM-FOR-GPS-DENIED-AREAS
This project enables AI-based sensor fusion for navigation in GPS-denied environments. It uses accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and barometers to maintain accurate positioning. Advanced algorithms dynamically manage sensor data, making it ideal for robotics, UAVs, and defense systems lacking GPS access.
